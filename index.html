        <p>Dependency management [17]
            A software dependency is an external standalone library that can be as small as a single file or as big as multiple files and folders organized into packages to perform a specific task.
            
            There are two types of dependencies:
            •	Direct dependencies are the libraries referenced directly by your application.
            •	Transitive dependencies are the libraries your dependencies are calling; on a basic level, they are a dependency of a dependency.
            
            Dependency management is a technique for identifying, resolving, and patching dependencies in your application’s codebase.
            A dependency manager is a software module that helps integrate external libraries or packages into your larger application stack.
            
            Outdated dependencies can impact your software application in a number of ways:
            •	Security.
            •	Performance improvements.
            •	Quality assurance.
            •	License compliance.
            
            It is really difficult to keep up with dependencies by your own for software codebases with hundreds of modules, this is where npm comes in.

            It is the default package (dependency) manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. 
            Stated by its creators, npm is the world's largest software registry. The name npm (Node Package Manager)
            stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js.
